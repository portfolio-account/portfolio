        <span> Namaste üôè ! My name is Shishir Sonekar, I write code for living. I like to summarize it for myself as someone who tells computers what to do, and how to do it. And, I bring on the table immense passion for building great businesses around it. I am professionally building and shipping üöÄ stuff since 2015. And, you are welcome to my corner of the internet.

        I have worked with some of the most interesting global startups in last 8 years. Joined some of them as their founding engineer and some other to fuel their growth. You can find my previous projects <a href="{{site.url}}/projects">here</a>.

    <!-- I like building tech based products / fuelling growth in traditional businesses through tech.  -->

            On 13th April 23, I decided to take a break from consulting for a while to focus on my side-project full time. These days, I spend my time mostly reading about new tech, upgrading skills, observing internet businesses, and primarily on building portfolio of <a target="_blank"  href="https://smallbets.co/">small bets</a> on the internet. I have promised myself to earn my first dollar on the internet before 2024 (that doesn't come from consulting paycheck). I may resume back the consulting if I run out of savings. And, I am actively documenting my journey on <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/shishirviz">Twitter</a>.

            I have this a Idea board in my Notion workflow. Here, every time I have an idea, I write it down before I forget about it. TBH, most of them are bullshit, I just write it down so that I can revisit them, I‚Äôd see which ones are promising and which keep coming back to me, and then picking one idea at a time and work on its MVP implementation until I launch it to the press. Because, I believe the best way to validate any idea is to test the market through launching MVP before building the full business.
