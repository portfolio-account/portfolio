            I recently got laid off at <a href="https://ivs.tv/">IVS</a>. So, I finally decided to take a break from consulting for a while to focus on my side projects full time. I may resume back to consulting if I run out of my savings. I spend my time mostly reading about new tech, observing internet businesses, building portfolio of <a href="https://smallbets.co/">small bets</a> on the internet. I have taken a pledge to earn my first dollar on the internet before 2024 (ofcourse without consulting). And, I am actively documenting my journey on <a href="https://twitter.com/shishirviz">Twitter</a>.
